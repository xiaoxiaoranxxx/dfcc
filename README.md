Mature play not free and easy <br/>
When after a lot of want to say<br/>
Happy or not happy<br/>
It's just a puzzle<br/>
So please leave me alone<br/>
Sad is life<br/>
What a ridiculous mistake to freeze into fire<br/>
The loneliness of eyes<br/>
Never been considered by you<br/>
I hope you did come<br/>
You are the light, my wings<br/>
When I get hurt again<br/>
Will give me strength<br/>
The wind and frost along the way<br/>
I'll keep that in mind<br/>
And you'll sail for me<br/>
You are the light, like the sun<br/>
When I'm lost again<br/>
Will give me direction<br/>
The courage of the journey<br/>
It's my growth<br/>
And you'll ride the waves<br/>
Sad is life<br/>
What a ridiculous mistake to freeze into fire<br/>
The loneliness of eyes<br/>
Never in your discretion<br/>
I hope you've been here<br/>
You are the light of my wings<br/>
When I get hurt again<br/>
Will give me strength<br/>
The wind and frost along the way<br/>
I'll keep that in mind<br/>
And you'll sail for me<br/>
You are light like the sun<br/>
When I'm lost again<br/>
Will give me direction<br/>
The courage of the journey<br/>
It's my growth<br/>
And you'll ride the waves<br/>
You are the light of my wings<br/>
When I get hurt again<br/>
Will give me strength<br/>
The wind and frost along the way<br/>
I'll keep that in mind<br/>
And you'll sail for me<br/>
You are light like the sun<br/>
When I'm lost again<br/>
Will give me direction<br/>
The courage of the journey<br/>
It's my growth<br/>
And you'll ride the waves<br/>
